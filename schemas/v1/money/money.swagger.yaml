    ## `Money`

    The `Money` archetype represents an amount of a specific `Currency`.

    ## `Currency`


    This `Currency` implements `Metric` and is `acceptedIn` one or more
    `Locales`. `Currency's` unique identifier is its `alphabeticCode`.


    At present, there are two fundamentally different types of currency -- those
    that are specified by ISO and those that are not.

    1. **`IsoCurrency`** represents a type of `Currency` with [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) definitions for

        - `name`,
        - `alphabeticCode`, and
        - `numericCode`.

    2. **`NonIsoCurrency`** represents a type of `Currency` that is _not_
    defined in any ISO specification. These types of currency might unrecognized
    or arbitrary "rewards," like American Airlines AAdvantage Miles.

    ## `Payment` and `PaymentMethod`

    The `Payment` archetype represents `Money` paid by one `Party` to another in return for goods or services. A `PaymentMethod` is a medium by which `Money` is transferred.


    ### `PaymentCard`




    ### `CreditCard`


    ### `DebitCard`


    ### `GiftCard`


    ### `Donation`


    ### `Cash` and `DigitalCurrency`



    ### `Check`



    ## Compliance with existing standards

    * [OMG Currency Specification v1.0]('http://www.omg.org/spec/CURR/1.0/PDF'): A standard to support international currency.

    * [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html): Three- and two-letter currency codes, currency numbers, and currency names.

    * [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html): Two-letter country codes and country names.

          which the client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD

          of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
          condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method.
          User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user.
